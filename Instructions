Here is the pig latin script (ruby or javascript): 
Step 1. (lower case consonant) Write a function that performs this translation (pig -> igpay) and write a test that validates the function

Step2 .  (lower case vowel) Modify the function to handle this translation (egg -> eggay) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass.

Step 3 (uppercase consonant) Modify the function to handle this translation (Hello -> Ellohay) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass. 

Step 4. (uppercase vowel) Modify the function to handle this translation (Orange -> Orangeay) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass.

Step 5. (multiple consonants)  Modify the function to handle this translation (Struck -> Uckstray) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass.

Step 6. (multiple words)  Modify the function to handle this translation (Hello world -> Ellohay orldway) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass.

Step 7. (punctuation)  Modify the function to handle this translation (Hello, world. -> Ellohay, orldway.) and write a test that validates that this and all previous test pass.

This will help you with string and array manipulation which are both skills that you will use everyday when building complex javascript applications
